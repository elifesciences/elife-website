Feature: Footnote
  In Order to be able to see the Institutions the author is associated with
  As a reader
  I should be able to see the list of institutions in the author tooltip

  Scenario Outline: List of institutions author is associated with is shown in the tooltip
    Given the markup service is available
    And there is an article:
      """
        {
          "title": "VOR <eloc>",
          "version": 1,
          "doi": "10.7554/eLife.<eloc>",
          "volume": <volume>,
          "elocation-id": "e<eloc>",
          "article-id": "10.7554/eLife.<eloc>",
          "article-version-id": "<eloc>.1",
          "pub-date": "2014-10-14T00:00:00+00:00",
          "path": "content/<volume>/e<eloc>v1",
          "article-type": "research-article",
          "status": "VOR",
          "publish": true,
          "contributors": [
            {
              "equal-contrib": true,
              "type": "author",
              "id": "<id>",
              "surname": "Alegado",
              "given-names": "<author>"
            }
          ]
        }
      """
    And I go to "content/<volume>/e<eloc>v1"
    Then I should see "<author>" in the ".author-tooltip-name" element
    And I should see "<aff>" in the ".author-list-full" element

    Examples:
      | eloc  | volume | id        | author  | aff                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
