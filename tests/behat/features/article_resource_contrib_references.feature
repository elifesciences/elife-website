@api
Feature: Article Resource - Contributor references (API)
  In order to maintain article content
  As a production system
  I need to be able to assign contributor references to the article via the resource api

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "eLife Article Publisher" role
    And I am authenticating as the Drupal user

  Scenario: Set contributor foot note references
    Given I set header "Content-Type" with value "application/json"
    And I send a POST request to "api/article.json" with body:
      """
