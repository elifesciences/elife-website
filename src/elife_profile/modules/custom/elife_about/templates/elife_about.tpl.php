      <p class="about-review-process__intro">At eLife, we&rsquo;ve taken a fresh approach to peer review to save you time, and to
        provide clear direction and constructive input. Decisions are quick and efficient; revision requests are designed
        to be clear and manageable; and multiple rounds of revision are usually avoided. Here&rsquo;s how it works:</p>

        <li>
          <h3 class="about-review-process__list_term">Initial decisions are delivered quickly</h3>
          <div class="about-review-process__list_definition">Our Senior editors decide whether initial submissions are
            appropriate for in-depth peer review, usually in consultation with members of the Board of Reviewing
            Editors.</div>

          <h3 class="about-review-process__list_term">Active scientists make all decisions</h3>
          <div class="about-review-process__list_definition">A Senior editor assigns a member of the Board of Reviewing
            Editors to oversee the peer-review process. The Reviewing editor usually reviews the article him or herself,
            calling on one or two additional reviewers as needed.</div>

          <h3 class="about-review-process__list_term">Revision requests are consolidated</h3>
          <div class="about-review-process__list_definition">Reviewers get together online to discuss their recommendations,
            refining their feedback, and striving to provide clear and concise guidance. If the work needs essential
            revisions before it can be published, the Reviewing editor incorporates those requirements into a single set
            of instructions.</div>

          <h3 class="about-review-process__list_term">Limited rounds of revision</h3>
          <div class="about-review-process__list_definition">Additional rounds of revision are largely eliminated, as the
            Reviewing editor is able to assess most revised submissions without further outside review.</div>
